This repository is comprised of our coding questions, the thinking processes for each question, and the codes for each question in Python, JavaScript, and Kotlin

Question one
Design a program that processes a list of items and identifies items that appear uniquely within it. Consider how you might want to organize and check for uniqueness


Question two
You are building  a system to track the most frequently accessed web pages on a high-traffic website. Could you implement a solution that tracks the page accessed the most and returns the top 5 accessed pages?

Question three
Design a delivery scheduling system for an e-commerce business that needs to manage a fleet of delivery vehicles. The system should optimize routes, minimize delivery time and consumption, handle variations in delivery volumes, prioritize urgent deliveries, and adapt routes in real-time based on traffic conditions.
